# ALX Solution Architect â€“ Cloud Computing Lab Summary

## Overview

This lab focuses on automating **cloud infrastructure deployment** using **AWS CloudFormation**, a service that allows defining infrastructure as code (IaC). Using templates, you can deploy, update, and manage AWS resources reliably and consistently.

---

## Cloud Computing Concepts Covered

* **Infrastructure as Code (IaC):** Define networks, compute, and security using YAML templates.
* **Layered Architecture:** Deploy infrastructure in layers for modularity:

  * **Network Layer:** VPC, subnets, routing
  * **Application Layer:** EC2 instances, security groups
* **Automation & Repeatability:** Templates enable automatic deployment without manual intervention.
* **Resource Management:** Use outputs, imports, and DeletionPolicy to share resources and preserve critical data.
* **Visualization:** CloudFormation Designer provides a visual representation of resources and dependencies.

---

## Lab Workflow

1. **Deploy Networking Layer:**

   * Stack: `lab-network`
   * Creates VPC and public subnet.
   * Outputs IDs for use in other stacks.

2. **Deploy Application Layer:**

   * Stack: `lab-application`
   * Creates EC2 instance and security group in the existing VPC.
   * Uses outputs from the networking stack.

3. **Update Stack:**

   * Add HTTPS traffic to security group using `lab-application2.yaml`.
   * Demonstrates safe incremental updates.

4. **Explore Templates:**

   * CloudFormation Designer visualizes and edits resources interactively.

5. **Delete Stack:**

   * Application stack deleted while **preserving EBS snapshots**.
   * Network stack remains for future reuse.

---

## Key Takeaways

* Automating deployment ensures **consistency, speed, and reliability**.
* Layered deployment improves **modularity and collaboration** across teams.
* Infrastructure as Code provides a **versioned, auditable, and repeatable** approach.
* AWS CloudFormation allows **safe updates and deletion policies** to protect resources.
